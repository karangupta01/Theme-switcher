## 🎨 Theme Switcher App

A **Theme Switcher App** built using **React JS** and **Vite**, allowing users to toggle between **Dark Mode** and **Light Mode** with a simple button. This project leverages **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useContext`) and the **Context API** to manage global state and dynamically update the theme across multiple components. It’s a perfect project to understand:

- 🌗 **Dark Mode & Light Mode** – Switch between themes to enhance the user experience.  
- ⚡️ **State Management** – Utilized `useState` for local state and `useContext` with the **Context API** for global state.  
- 🎯 **Context API Integration** – Centralized theme management for consistent UI updates.  
- 🧩 **Component-Based Architecture** – Modular and reusable component structure.  
- 🚀 **Vite-Powered Build** – Ensures fast build times and optimized performance.  

### 📚 Technologies Used
- ⚛️ **React JS** – Component-based library for building dynamic and interactive UIs.  
- ⚡️ **Vite** – Ultra-fast build tool for modern React apps.  
- 🔥 **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Modern syntax and best practices for clean code.  
- 🧠 **React Hooks** – Used `useState` for local state, `useContext` for global state, and **Context API** for managing app-wide themes.
